#### *About:*


Kurafte token has some very unique and innovative features that are not found in any other token:

  
  
**Mining with any device, with no electricity costs**  

*The advantages of a cryptocurrency without electricity-dependent mining include eliminating the environmental footprint by mitigating carbon emissions and promoting sustainability. Mining becomes more energy-efficient, allowing computational power to be repurposed for productive tasks and reducing overall energy consumption. The absence of electricity requirements enhances accessibility, enabling broader participation in the network and promoting decentralization. Additionally, miners can save costs by removing dependence on expensive electricity providers, leading to increased profitability and more efficient resource allocation.*

_Environmental Impact_: The most significant advantage is eliminating the environmental footprint. Currently, mining consumes a substantial amount of electricity, primarily sourced from fossil fuels. Removing this energy-intensive process would mitigate the carbon emissions associated with mining and contribute to a greener and more sustainable future.

_Energy Efficiency_: Without the need for electricity, mining is significantly energy-efficient. The computational power currently utilized for mining can be repurposed for other productive tasks, reducing overall energy consumption and promoting greater efficiency in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

_Accessibility and Decentralization_: Eliminating the electricity requirement makes Kurafte more accessible to individuals worldwide. Mining operations often require substantial investments in specialized hardware and high electricity costs, favouring those with access to cheap energy sources. Removing this barrier would promote a more decentralized mining power distribution and enable broader participation in the Bitcoin network.

_Cost Savings_: By removing the dependence on electricity for mining, individuals and mining operations are no longer subject to fluctuating and often high electricity costs from expensive providers. Miners no longer need to factor in electricity expenses when deciding their mining operations, making it a more attractive and economically viable endeavour. This results in significant cost savings for miners, allowing them to allocate resources more efficiently and potentially increase profitability.

#### *FAQ:*

  

**What technology is behind Kurafte's mining process that allows it to be done without electricity dependency?**

Kurafte is just the beginning and a pointer to new possibilities. By being a token on the Ethereum network, it does not need to reproduce the functions of the network, and it is therefore doing a piggyback ride to reduce electricity costs. It uses a simple mathematical model to distribute the tokens and applies a mining and swap fee. Instead of having an organization that takes this fee for themselves, it is shared across the network so everyone can earn from this token. In future, should enough funds be obtained, we plan to develop and patent a currency based on Bitcoin's proof of work that needs no electricity for mining.

  

  
**How does Kurafte ensure the price of their token never falls and only rises?**

Kurafte is using the emulated bonding curves while mimicking Bitcoin's distribution model. Bonding curves allow for a fixed and predetermined price discovery mechanism set in blockchain stone and cannot be cheated. One of the constraints that we have found on the Ethereum network and Solidity programming language is that there are no decimals or negative numbers, and therefore, all mathematical functions and computation must be simplified.


**Can Kurafte be seamlessly converted to other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies without exchanges?**
Although it is possible to make a contract that acts as a mediator between contracts with the same wrapping mechanism, nothing beyond Kurafte will be developed. A way to convert the swap from Kurafte to Ethereum and then exchange it with a Fiat (or to do this in reverse) is under investigation.

 

 **What consensus mechanism is used for Kurafte to validate transactions and maintain the security and integrity of the network?**
The security of the contract is the openly available and freely distributed source code. All other security is a matter of the Ethereum network.


**Are any use cases, partnerships, or projects built on or around Kurafte that showcase its utility and potential?**
Since it is a completely decentralized entity, anyone can use Kurafte however they want.

**How do Kurafte's transaction speed and fees compare to other popular cryptocurrencies?**
The Ethereum network and Ethereum GAS fees regulate Kurafte's transaction speed and fees.

  
**What measures are in place to prevent the centralization of mining power or influence within the Kurafte network?**
Controlling the mining and swapping by the bonding curve, and avoiding the need for expensive hardware, is a way to ensure the proper and fair distribution.


**What is the total supply of Kurafte tokens, and is there a cap on the maximum supply?**
The maximum supply is around 21 million tokens, however, the number of the mined tokens will always fluctuate since the swap mechanism burns the tokens while the mining mechanism mints the tokens.

  

**How can users store and secure their Kurafte tokens, and what wallet options are available?**
This is done by using any open-source Ethereum wallet such as Meta-Mask. The private keys are the user's responsibility.

  
**How can a newcomer to the cryptocurrency space get started with owning, mining, or using Kurafte tokens?**
We provide a software solution to access the Ethereum network and enable users to mine the token automatically.

  

**What is the regulatory status of Kurafte in different jurisdictions, and can it be used globally without legal concerns?**
Since this is a completely decentralized entity, we do not know of and take no responsibility for such regulations.

  

**Are there any plans for Kurafte to be listed on popular cryptocurrency tracking websites or become available on popular trading platforms?**

Although Kurafte does not need an exchange, we are considering any exchanges that would list Kurafte as a community project that would either mine or purchase the tokens independently. This is simply because we have no means or control of the contract or mint the specific amounts of tokens. Some exchanges ask for a certain amount of tokens to be distributed, which could be very expensive in Kurafte's case.



**Do early investors profit the most?**

Although early investors profit, they also distribute their wealth the most since there is a fee to swap back Kurafte to its native currency. Furthermore, given the regulated mining and swap mechanisms, early investors must apply more effort to convert Kurafte back to its original currency. Furthermore, the controlled mining/minting mechanism ensures that all tokens are spread out equally and that nobody gets an unfair advantage.


**Is it a security?**

No, because of the simple fact that it is pegged to Ethereum rather than USD or any other stable currency. Since Ethereum is not a security, as an implication, Kurafte cannot be a security. If it were pegged to USD, it would be a security.

**Is it just a store of value?**

Although Kurafte wraps around its native currency, it is not a store of value. The value comes from Kurafte being a micro-utility and an exchange. Its biggest value is the community and a fair and regulated distribution.


**Is pooling a bad thing?**

Unfortunately, there is no way to distribute the fees across the network other than by pooling. It had to be applied as a working mechanism. Please see the source code or find someone who can interpret it for you, and invest in Kurafte at your own risk. Otherwise, you can take our word for it: it is not a bad thing if done and is used properly, and everything was properly done.


**When should I invest in Kurafte?**

- If you plan to bring more users to mine or swap Kurafte.
- If you can sell it in exchange for a higher price than the mining price you paid.
- If you want to become a long-term investor and are sure of the project's success.
- If you can afford the maximum loss of 4% of your investment.
- If you are ready to invest in Ethereum, as long as you are ready to invest in Kurafte.

  

**Why should I invest in Kurafte?**

 -  If you want to earn money by helping others earn the money too.
   - If you want to practice and benefit from a collective where everyone pays a tax.
   - If you have a plan and can promote Kurafte in a way that would benefit you and everyone else.
   - If you believe in decentralized community projects and are willing to help Kurafte pave its way to become an independent technology on its decentralized network.
- If you want to deflate and increase a demand of Ethereum by enclosing it within Kurafte.
